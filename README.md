## Design Process
-------

Before starting any design at all, I mapped out the content that would need to be displayed on the site. Using trello to brainstorm, I got a pretty good idea of the total amount of content that would potentially be included in the final product.

After this point I could start to prioritise the content in my head and get started on the wireframes.

### Inspiration & Moodboarding

My initial inspiration for the mood of the design came from the style of designers such as Massimo Vignelli.

I wanted to emulate the bright contrasting colours alongside the minimalist style. 

#####Mood Board

I also like to experiment with pixel art and had created a small avatar of myself (pictured below) that I wanted to incorporate, largely inspired by the pixel style of the Super Nintendo game "Chrono Trigger".

##### Colour

The colour scheme I decided on was quite a bright one. I wanted three primary colours that would stand out and two very muted ones to support them.

##### Logo
Another important design element was my logo. Using my initials as a starting point, and incorporating the colour palette, this is what I came up with.

### Wireframes

My initial wireframes were very rough. I wanted to go for a minimalist design to begin with, so I was hesitant to put too much detail in to begin with. I know how over enthusiastic I can get with adding features as I go so I wanted to allow for a little bit of that. 


#### Hand Drawn Wireframes

I translated these into some slightly higher fidelity digital wireframes (pictured below). At this point I could get a better idea of the size of the content within the page. I focused on the mobile design first and was happy with how this helped me to strip down my design and make it as minimal as possible.
