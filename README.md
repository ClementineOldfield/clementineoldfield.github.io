## Design Process
-------

Before starting any design at all, I mapped out the content that would need to be displayed on the site. Using trello to brainstorm, I got a pretty good idea of the total amount of content that would potentially be included in the final product. After this point I could start to prioritise the content in my head and get started on the wireframes.

### Inspiration & Moodboarding

My initial inspiration for the mood of the design came from the style of designers such as Massimo Vignelli. I wanted to emulate the bright contrasting colours alongside the minimalist style present in his works.

##### Mood Board

I also like to experiment with pixel art and had created a small avatar of myself (pictured below) that I wanted to incorporate, largely inspired by the pixel style of the Super Nintendo game "Chrono Trigger".

##### Colour

The colour scheme I decided on was quite a bright one. I wanted three primary colours that would stand out and two very muted ones to support them. The complimentary pairing of blue and orange was my starting point, and the red brought a nice contrast to the trio. The off-white and off-black would be my background and text colours.<br>

##### Logo
Another important design element was my logo. Using my initials as a starting point, and incorporating the colour palette, this is what I came up with.
<img width="300px" style="display: block" src="docs/logo-progression.jpg" />
I was able to turn this into an SVG so that I could affect each segment individually with CSS. Here is an example from the finished site:

### Wireframes

My initial wireframes were very rough. I wanted to go for a minimalist design, so I was hesitant to put too much detail in to begin with. I know how over enthusiastic I can get with adding features as I go so I wanted to allow for a little bit of that. 


#### Hand Drawn Wireframes

I translated these into some slightly higher fidelity digital wireframes (pictured below). At this point I could get a better idea of the size of the content within the page. I focused on the mobile design first and was happy with how this helped me to strip down my design and make it as minimal as possible.
